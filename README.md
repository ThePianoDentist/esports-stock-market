# esports-stock-market


I DID NOT GOOGLE HARD ENOUGH. TURNS OUT ESL ALREADY HAVE THIS FANTASY SYSTEM ACROSS MULTIPLE GAMES WHERE PLAYER VALUE FLUCTUATES BASED ON POPULARITY. 

(they do not appear to have leagues spanning multiple tournaments though, which I would like. However it means I'd rather focus on other projects first)

why?

because current esports fantasy leagues suck.
because they are all independent to each esport....when you could share code/systems across all

how make better?

main thing is to have the usual x-budget which you 'buy' players for your team with.
However to make more fun/skilly, the price of players is dynamic throughout the season, rising and falling based on popularity.
So it's like a stock market.

one other fantasy league idea I like is being automaticlly entered into a league with random players, ON TOP OF having friend leagues. Not everyone has enough friends interested to make a good league.

implementation?

using go and postgres for web shenanigans (might want a js framework as well)
ideally designed responsively from start
write apis for each main sport to grab fantasy league data
(will start with LoL, because dota has a fantasy_points api-call which is coming soon.
 Also I dislike the fantasyLCS system.
 Lol has no api so needs scraping, only would need to scrape once a day max so not an issue)
