fantasy league with dynamic player values

Will use Golang, Postgres
So 3 main parts
1) Call api. throw data we care about into db. update fantasy points
2) website thingy. users can log in. make a team. update their team etc. go backend. some bullshit js frontend. single-page-app?
3) .....ball out of control?

- try and actually make site responsive 1st time round. dont have to fuck about rewriting.
